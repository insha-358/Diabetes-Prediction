# Diabetes-Prediction
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict whether an individual is likely to develop diabetes based on various health metrics such as BMI, insulin levels, and age.

# Features
Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on key health indicators.
Implements machine learning model: Logistic Regression.

# Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML/CSS
Backend: Django, Python

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes Pedigree Function: Likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age of the patient (years)
The target variable is Outcome which is 1 if the patient has diabetes, and 0 otherwise.

# Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical operations
scikit-learn for building machine learning models

# Future Improvements
Implement a deep learning model using neural networks to further enhance the accuracy.
Use additional features such as cholesterol levels and physical activity for better predictions.
